if running the project on a new computer, install node, install git, and run

npm install -g http-server

(you may need to add "sudo" before "npm" to get permission)


every time we run the project

open a terminal

navigate to this project
cd ~/Documents/creative-coding-ii/moonphase

start the server:
http-server -c-1

Then point your browser at http://localhost:8080/

while working on a project:

open a terminal, navigate to your project

do this if you added new files:
git add .

cd == change directory
ls == list
